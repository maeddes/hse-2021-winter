[cloud-intro]

== Module: Cloud Introduction (theory-block I)

* What is Cloud Computing? Encounters in everyday life and history
* Characteristic, advantages & challenges
* Terminology - public, private, hybrid, dedicated
* Abstraction layers - IaaS, PaaS, FaaS, SaaS
* Overview - Hypervisors, virtual machines, containers and orchestration
* Overview - Global cloud service providers (CSPs), technologies and corresponding offerings

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student is able to describe cloud computing in own words and list examples for offerings, topologies and technologies. Includes ability to differentiate between different abstraction layers and knowledge how those layers and according technologies interact with each other. No exercises in this module_

=== Review questions

* What modern, current technologies relate to the topic of distributed computing. List 3 and explain why.
* Describe 3 abstraction layers of cloud (incl. abbreviation) and list a technology example for each.
* What characteristics and features can I expect as a service consumer from the various layers.
* List pros and cons for cloud (generic) - X examples each

=== Open Questions

* Differences between FaaS and API

== Module: Spring Boot Introduction

* Background: Spring Framework - History & components
* Spring <- -> Spring Boot
* Spring Initializr (start.spring.io) & starter dependencies
* Basic project structure (folders, configuration ..)
* "Hello, World!" example explained
* Using Actuator

=== Objectives
_The student is able to build and configure an own Spring Boot application from scratch with the IDE of choice. The exercise is to build an own "Hello, World!" application that exposes various REST endpoints and is able to execute CRUD operations on the state of the application. Optional: Add logging and testing, configure Actuator._

=== Exercises

* Build a simple Spring Boot Microservice with the following starter dependencies: Web, Actuator
* Run the microservice and test the endpoint /actuator/health and /actuator/info
* Annotate the Microservice with @RestController and implement a "Hello, World!" method, which responds to an HTTP GET request.
* Add some basic "functionality" to make the service react to HTTP GET, POST calls (e.g. modify an internal list). Optional: PUT and DELETE
* Change the configuration to make the server run on port 8081 instead of 8080

=== Review questions

* Describe the difference between Spring and Spring Boot
* What kind of configurations can be set/done through start.spring.io (Spring Initializr) 
* Describe the role or various functionalities/endpoints of the Actuator 
* List 3 examples of settings to be externally configured in application.properties

== Module: Spring Boot Next Steps

* Recap of Spring Boot Intro Module
* Live coding of Controller with CRUD endpoints (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Using Logger with SL4J
* Interacting with the application through REST Clients
* Demonstrate dynamic behaviour
* Outlook: "Big picture" of lecture

=== Objectives
_The student is able to build and configure an own Spring Boot application from scratch with the IDE of choice. The exercise is to build a fully logging-enabled application that exposes various REST endpoints and is able to execute CRUD operations to modify an internal list of Strings. This includes dynamic configuration of the actuator component and logging levels._

=== Exercises

* Build a simple Spring Boot Microservice with the following starter dependencies: Web, Actuator
* Create an internal list of objects (Strings)
* Add some basic "functionality" to make the service react to HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE calls (e.g. modify an internal list)
* Log the activity using Logger (ex. SL4J)

== Module: Container Intro

* What are containers and how do they work
* Containers vs. VMs 
* History of containers and rise of Docker
* Docker concepts: daemon, hub, dockerfile, CLI
* Running containers with various options

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student understands the concepts and use cases of container technology and is able to describe them. The first exercise is to pull sample images from an image registry (e.g. Docker Hub) and interact with them (run, expose port, execute shell, cleanup etc). After that the student can show how to build a custom image via Dockerfile and push it to a registry for others to access. Complete the exercises handed out via URL._
